# Reflexive example code
`` Reflexive
release(score) = 101

so score => 100 do
    write("score is equal or more huge than 100!")
stop

so score =< 100 do
    write("score is tinier or equal to 100!")
stop``
should output condition one with some debugging
# How to install
drop the reflexive file in your main shell terminal app directory or if in termux make a folder with reflexive file inside and do `cd /path/to/directory
make
cp reflexive $PREFIX/bin/` this should make it work then make a file with .rfx as extension and working code, go to terminal then run "reflexive [filename].rfx" and the file if correct should work
# Documentary
This was made November 15 2025 on Saturday out of boredom, and made with the full use of DeepSeek AI. The design was 100% by me, coding 100% by DeepSeek.
# Structure
Reflexive was made using ANSI C, uses bytecode, elf binary. This is my first project on this account. Thank you for coming.
